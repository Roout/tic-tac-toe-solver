# This project solves the problem of the AI for the tic-tac-toe game

**Used algorithms:**  

- [x] Minimax
- [x] Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- [x] MCTS<sup>[1]</sup>

Note, MCTS uses backpropagation of a scalar reward with negamax<sup>[1]</sup> whereas the alternative approach will be to backpropagate a vector delta.
